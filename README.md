Moving your project from a legacy version control system is easy. If your project is currently on Subversion, Mercurial or another Git server, you can take it to the next level with GitHub's collaborative tools, uncompromised security, and premier third-party apps. 

This course helps you seamlessly migrate a project using GitHub's importer tool. Along the way, we will also discuss important steps for preparing and sharing your project. 

In this course, you’ll learn how to:

- Prepare your project for a successful migration
- Handle any binary files currently stored in your project
- Create important Git files like a `.gitignore`
- Import your project to GitHub
